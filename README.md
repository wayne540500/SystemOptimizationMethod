Lane Changing of Data Driven Vehicles

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization & Mapping). 
It is a method to generates the map of a vehicleâ€™s surroundings and locates the vehicle in 
that map at the same time. The SLAM system uses the depth sensors such as 3D Cameras 
to gather a series of views , with approximate position and distance. Then, it stores these 3D 
views in memory. 

How does SLAM Navigate? 

The idea of SLAM is inspired by a person trying to figure out their way in an unknown/unfamiliar place.
Initial step is the person looking around to recognize familiar markers, landmarks or signs. Once the
person recognizes a familiar landmark, they figure out where they are in relation to it. However, the more
that person observes the environment, the more landmarks the person will recognize and begin to build
an image, or map, of that place. The person may have to navigate this certain environment several times
before becoming familiar with a previously unknown place

Requirement of SLAM

In order for SLAM to collect information from the environment, it requires ,measurement devices,
the most commonly used tools of measurement is a laser scanner such as LiDAR.
-The laser scans can capture pinpoint accurate data throughout the interior, offering a higher level
of accuracy in measurement.
-Calibration is an important factor for accuracy and reliability, however it can be time-consuming
and costly, requiring special equipment and skills.
-Generally, the measurement device used depends on several variables, including preferences,
costs, and availability
